Scientific Literature Support:\n               Rapamycin has a growing body of preclinical evidence supporting its potential in Alzheimer's disease through inhibition of mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), enhancing autophagy, and reducing protein aggregation. Key studies include work by Caccamo et al. (2010) showing improved cognitive function and reduced pathology in AD mouse models, and Richardson et al. (2015) demonstrating reduced A\u03b2 and tau pathology through enhanced autophagy.\n               \n            2. Clinical Trials and Animal Studies:\n               - No large-scale clinical trials specifically for AD have been completed\n               - Phase 1b AMBAR trial (NCT04200911) is evaluating rapamycin in mild cognitive impairment\n               - Multiple rodent studies including:\n                 * Caccamo et al. (2010): Improved cognition in 3xTg-AD mice\n                 * Spilman et al. (2010): Reduced A\u03b2 and improved cognition in PDAPP mice\n                 * Lin et al. (2017): Rescued synaptic and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice\n                 * Jiang et al. (2014): Decreased tau pathology via enhanced autophagy\n               \n            3. Evidence Strength:\n               The evidence for rapamycin in AD is MODERATE in preclinical models but PRELIMINARY in humans. Animal studies consistently show benefits, but human data is limited primarily to observational studies and small trials. Strong mechanistic rationale exists based on autophagy enhancement and metabolic benefits observed in longevity studies.\n               \n            4. Contradictory Findings:\n               - Some studies report potential negative effects on neuronal function with prolonged mTOR inhibition (e.g., Talboom et al., 2015)\n               - Concern exists about potential side effects (immunosuppression, delayed wound healing, metabolic effects)\n               - Questions remain about optimal dosing, as intermittent dosing may provide benefits while minimizing side effects\n               - The translation gap between rodent studies and human application remains significant\n               \n               The balance of evidence suggests rapamycin has strong potential for repurposing in AD, but optimal timing, dosing, and formulation require further investigation.\n            "
