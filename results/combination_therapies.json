  "Memantine + Donepezil": "1. Memantine: NMDA receptor antagonist that helps reduce glutamate excitotoxicity, which is elevated in Alzheimer's disease. It blocks excessive NMDA receptor activity without disrupting normal function.\n\n2. Donepezil: Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases acetylcholine levels in the brain by preventing its breakdown. It helps compensate for the loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer's.\n\n3. Curcumin: Natural polyphenol with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It reduces neuroinflammation through inhibition of NF\u03baB signaling and can bind to amyloid-beta, preventing aggregation.\n\n4. Rapamycin: mTOR inhibitor that enhances autophagy, helping clear protein aggregates like amyloid-beta and tau. It attenuates neuroinflammation through regulation of microglial activation.\n\n5. Sodium selenate: Activates PP2A phosphatase which dephosphorylates tau proteins, potentially reducing tau hyperphosphorylation and subsequent neurofibrillary tangle formation.\n\n6. GV-971 (Sodium oligomannate): Novel oligosaccharide that remodels gut microbiota, reducing amino acid-shaped metabolites associated with neuroinflammation. It also appears to reduce amyloid-beta deposition.\n\n7. ISRIB: Integrated stress response inhibitor that enhances translation and potentially reduces neuroinflammation while supporting synaptic function and memory consolidation.\n\n8. NMZ (J147): Curcumin derivative that acts on multiple pathways, including mitochondrial function, inflammation, and oxidative stress. It can reduce amyloid and tau pathology in animal models.\n\n9. Aducanumab: Monoclonal antibody that selectively targets aggregated forms of amyloid-beta, helping to clear amyloid plaques and potentially slow disease progression in early stages.\n\n10. CMS121: Synthetic flavonoid that protects against lipid peroxidation and ferroptosis, preserving mitochondrial function and reducing oxidative damage.",
